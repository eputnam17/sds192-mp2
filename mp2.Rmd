# There are some weird negative contribution amounts, which I assume are cancelled checks. We should do a better job removing those but it was really skewing the data so I removed the negative contributions and did calculations from here on with only postive contributions
ContributionsToEachPositive <- ContributionsToEach %>%
  filter(transaction_amt > 0)

#Can we filter out cancelled transactions by filtering out any observation that has a non-unique tran_id? Let's look at contributions for one candidate who had a lot of cancelled donations:
ContributionsToConyers <- ContributionsToEach %>% filter(cand_id == "H6MI01028")
#No - because cancellations receive a unique tran_id. Looking at this dataset, there are many cases where I can't figure out which transaction matches with each cancellation, so I do not think it is possible to filter out cancelled donations with the information we have - we could filter out the negative transactions, but then we would still have the donations that were cancelled.

Although all United States presidential elections are unique, the 2011 â€“ 2012 campaign data is particularly interesting. In addition to the first time in U.S. history that an African American incumbent president ran for re-election, this was the first election to occur after the 2010 Supreme Court opinion, Citizens United, which removed many of the restrictions regulating political campaign spending.
