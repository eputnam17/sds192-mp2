## SARAH GILLESPIE TESSTTTTTT
## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")

#Berry says Hi!!!

> Word count: `r wordcountaddin::word_count()`

```{r, message=FALSE}

# Splits contributions into the date it occurred, transaction amount, and the the recipient's ID
ContributionsToEach <- contributions %>%
  select(transaction_dt, transaction_amt, cand_id, name) %>%
# The date format was weird and ineffective so this splits it into 3 columns, for year, month, and day. I used "lubridate" which should be part of tidyverse
  mutate(FullDate = mdy(transaction_dt)) %>%
  separate(FullDate, sep="-", into = c("year", "month", "day"))

# There are some weird negative contribution amounts, which I assume are cancelled checks. We should do a better job removing those but it was really skewing the data so I removed the negative contributions and did calculations from here on with only postive contributions
ContributionsToEachPositive <- ContributionsToEach %>%
  filter(transaction_amt > 0)

#In progress: Remove cancelled donations
#Cancellations <- ContributionsToEach %>%
  #filter(transaction_amt < 0) 
#ContributionsToEachClean <- ContributionsToEachPositive %>%
  #filter(cand_id != [anything from Cancellations])

  
  

BigContributions2012 <- ContributionsToEachPositive %>%
  filter(year == "2012") %>%
  filter(transaction_amt > 3000000)

glimpse(BigContributions2012)
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# everything
# I loaded the scales package, which should be in ggplot of tidyverse to make the tranaction amount be in dollers and not exponants
ggplot(ContributionsToEachPositive, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = transaction_amt)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r, message=FALSE}

# just 2012 contributions on a log scale with text saying who donated each big donation.
# Democrat = MUNDY KATOWITZ MEDIA, GMMB, . Republican = MENTZER MEDIA SERVICES,CROSSROADS MEDIA, NATIONAL MEDIA RESEARCH PLANNING(?), AMERICAN RAMBLER PRODUCTIONS,

ggplot(BigContributions2012, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = transaction_amt, label = name)) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = dollar) +
  geom_text(size = 2) +
